# Summaries and Plots

Using the SSC system, the weather types moist tropical and dry tropical were selected to represent heat events. These included values 60 - 63 and 30 - 33. Data for each of the 15 stations was collected between 2016 - 2020 for the All-Payers Health Claims analysis, and 1970 - 2022 to assess if heat event days have been increasing in the state of Virginia over time. Dates were confined to May 1st to September 30th for each year. Days with the classification of 80 - 82 were considered as NA as they represent missing data, “day is missing”. In addition, one data set considering only “extreme” heat events was considered, where values of 61-63 and 31-33 were selected. Categories of days are heat event, non-heat event, or NA for each of the 15 SSC stations.  

The presented here summarizes: 1) the 50 year heat event dataset for Virginia, 2) the 2016 - 2020 heat event dataset for VA, 3) the 2016 - 2020 extreme heat event dataset for VA, 4) the 2016 - 2020 heat event dataset for the contiguous USA, and 5) the 2016 - 2020 extreme heat event dataset for the contiguous USA. Summaries include ranges, medians, and means.
