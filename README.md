# Summaries and Plots

Using the SSC system, the weather types moist tropical and dry tropical were selected to represent heat events. These included values 60 - 63 and 30 - 33. Data for each of the 15 stations was collected between 2016 - 2020 for the All-Payers Health Calims analysis, and 1970 - 2022 to assess if heat event days have been increaseing in the state of Virginia over time. Dates were confined to May 1st to September 30th for each year. Days with the classification of 80 - 82 were considered as NA as they represent missing data, “day is missing”. Categories of days are heat event, non-heat event, or NA for each of the 15 SSC stations.  

The the presented here summarizes the data for A) the 50 year data set for Virginia, B) the 2016 - 2020 dataset for Virginia, and C) the 2016 - 2020 dataset for the contiguous USA.
